# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Im Lucas Capriata from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Im currently learning about web development back end and devops tools such as k8s and docker.

### Disi-bot development:
- In 2020 my college called the best students of my course to work on a guided project with a teacher that act as a scrum master, and luckily i was chosen. I had to chose between some projects "Chatbot development" was the selected. We've worked all the year and finally we could launch a final version of the chatbot to the university website (only for my career). Here is a link with the chatbot if you want to test it: [Chatbot](http://www.sistemas.frba.utn.edu.ar/index.php/site-administrator/introduccion)

### Last Projects:
- At the beginning of 2021, a friend and i started developing a cloud-based SAAS. We called it Sahara-health and it is a software as a service for kinesiology centers
owners. This software allows you to have and manage a database with all your clients and employees so you can control all the medical shifts that happens in your kinesiology center. It is based on React with Next for the front-end, nodeJs for the back-end, Postgres as the db technology, based on microservices architecture using docker containers and kubernetes on the part of containers orchestration.
- We've already interviewed some professional and an owner of kinesiology center so we have the know-how of the business
- We have designed the architecture of modules and db structure
- Now it remains to develop the software and continue learning about all this wonderful technologies.
